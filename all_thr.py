# This script runs the following battery of tests:
# Chunk sizes: 64, 4096, 65536
# Test types: pipe, unix, tcp, tcp-nodelay, vmsplice-coop, shmem-pipe, mempipe-futex, mempipe-spin
# The latter 3 tests are repeated with a "safe" form that has the writer copy the data from shared memory before verification
# All tests use rep stosq to write buffers (data is the iteration count) and rep scasq to verify at the reader.
# All tests work in place so far as their underlying transport allows (so pipes involve 2 copies, vmsplice involves 1, rings involve 0).
# All tests will be repeated to test bandwidth between cores named on the command line: see below...

# Parameters for this script: 1st parameter is an output directory (will be created; all tests will be stored below this)
# All following parameters must be integers denoting a core followed by another denoting a numa node. 
# If you supply x y z w we will test 0-x allocating from node y, 0-z allocating from node w.
# We omit the mempipe-spin 0-0 test if it would otherwise be run as it's stupid.
